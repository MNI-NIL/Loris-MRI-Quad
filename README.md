# System Requirements
 * Perl
 * DICOM toolkit
 * MINC tools (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/MINC)

Note: For Ubuntu installations, DICOM toolkit will be installed by the imaging install script (see step 3 below). This script will apt-get install dcmtk.   

The following installation should be run by the $lorisadmin user. sudo permission is required.
See aces/Loris README.md for further information and Loris installation information. 

# Installation

1. Create directories

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /data/$projectname/bin/mri
   sudo chown -R lorisadmin:lorisadmin /data/$projectname
   cd /data/$projectname/bin
   git clone https://github.com/aces/Loris-MRI.git mri
   ```
   
2. Install Dicom-archive within the mri/ directory (created by the git clone command):

   ```bash
   cd /data/$projectname/bin/mri/
   git submodule init
   git submodule sync
   git submodule update
   ```

3. Run installer to install DICOM toolkit, Perl libraries, configure environment, and setup directories:

   ```bash 
   cd /data/$projectname/bin/mri/
   ./imaging_install.sh
   ```

  You will be asked for the following input: 

 * What is the database name? $dbname
 * What is the database host? $dbhost
 * What is the MySQL user? $lorisuser 
 * What is the MySQL password? 
 * What is the Linux user which the installation will be based on? $lorisadmin
 * What is the project name? $projectname
 * What is your email address? 
 * What prod file name would you like to use? default: prod  [leave blank]
 * Enter the list of Site names (space separated) site1 site2

Ensure that /home/$lorisadmin/.bashrc includes the statements: 

```source /data/$projectname/bin/mri/environment```

For MINC tools installed manually, ensure that the apache envvars file includes all the EXPORT statements
from minc-toolkit-config.sh (file located in the path where the MINC tools are installed), then restart apache.
This is necessary for Brainbrowser to successfully load MINC images.
